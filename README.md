# La Culture Physique de la Femme El√©gante

This is a bizarre little interactive experience made for [Train Jam 2016](http://trainjam.com), inspired by and using [these lovely images](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2016/02/08/exercise_advice_for_1920s_flappers_living_in_france_in_a_set_of_12_illustrations.html).

It may not make much sense without context (or with context, for that matter), but you may still find it entertaining to [play](http://lazerwalker.com/la-culture-physique). Use an iPhone.

Keep in mind that this was conceived and executed on a 52-hour train ride. It's basically only open-source so that I can use GitHub Pages hosting.

Art comes from the aforementioned article; audio comes from the Internet Archive's "78 RPM and Cylinder Recordings" collection.
